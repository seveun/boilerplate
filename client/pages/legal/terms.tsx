            OF SERVICE BY CLICKING HERE AND KEEP THEM FOR YOUR OWN RECORDS. IF

            If you are within the European Union (the "EU"), these EU Terms of
            Service constitute a legal contract that defines the relationship
            between you, the user ("you," "your," "yours," etc.), and us
            concerning the services provided to you through the Site
            ("Services"). This includes all text, images, graphics, photographs,
            audio, video, buttons, icons, animations, data, messages, software,
            and other content, information, or materials on RarityCase
            ("Materials"), as well as any Materials posted to or shared on the
            Site by you, such as posts made in the chatroom ("Content").

            The Services also encompass the deposit of in-store credits
            ("Credits"), which may be utilized to acquire virtual mystery boxes
            ("Boxes") and experience points ("XP"). Boxes, randomly determined,
            may contain XP or physical items ("Items") that can be redeemed,
            exchanged, or otherwise utilized. The value of the Items and/or XP
            revealed in a Box will always be equal to or greater than the price
            of the Box.

            the EU Terms of Service. Registering for more than one account may
            result in termination of either or both accounts on RarityCase,
            leading to forfeiture of associated rights and interests, including
            any XP or Items earned. Valid payment information is required for
            purchasing Boxes or XP and accessing other paid features. Failure to
            provide necessary information, provision of false details, or
            non-compliance with EU Terms of Service may lead to account
            termination, subject to the sole discretion of RarityCase.

            any time, including the submission of government-issued photo
            identification or tax ID number during registration. Failure to
            provide requested documentation may result in denial or restriction
            of access, withholding of funds, refusal of redemptions, exchanges,
            and other disposals of Item(s), and refusal of account closures.
            Users understand that RarityCase does not endorse or sponsor any

            Providing false, misleading, or inaccurate information, or failing
            to promptly update such information, may lead to the suspension or
            termination of the user's account. RarityCase has the right to
            refuse current or future site usage and may subject the user to
            criminal and civil liability in case of violation. Termination of
            the account renders membership, account, and discounts null and
            void, with users being responsible for a-la-carte billing for the
            services.

            to unauthorized persons makes the user liable for any resulting
            losses incurred by RarityCase or third parties.

            The costs of delivery (excluding customs, duties, or related

            acknowledge responsibility for all delivery and importation fees
            associated with the delivery of your Item(s). In some cases,
            third-party service providers may inform us of importation fee
            payment, while in other cases, your postman may attempt to collect
            importation fees. RarityCase disclaims responsibility for any

            providers. To avoid importation fees, you can contact support at
            support@raritycase.com before redeeming Item(s) to inquire about the
            shipping location. Once delivery and importation fees are paid, and
            all necessary information is provided, RarityCase will deliver the
            Item(s) as soon as reasonably possible, except in cases of delays
            due to events beyond its control. The average delivery time ranges
            between three (3) and thirty (30) days.

            that said notice was refused or deemed undeliverable by the postal
            authorities, messenger, email server, or overnight delivery service.
